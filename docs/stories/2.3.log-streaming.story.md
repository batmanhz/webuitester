# Story 2.3: Real-time Log Streaming

## Description
Implement a WebSocket connection to stream execution logs and screenshots from the Backend to the Frontend in real-time. This provides visibility into what the Agent is doing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **WebSocket Endpoint**: Create `/ws/logs/{run_id}` endpoint in Backend.
2.  **Log Broadcasting**:
    *   Agent emits events (`log`, `screenshot`, `step_start`, `step_end`).
    *   Backend broadcasts these events to connected clients.
3.  **Frontend Console**:
    *   Implement a "Console" component in the bottom panel.
    *   Display text logs with timestamps.
    *   Auto-scroll to bottom.
4.  **Screenshot Updates**: Update the "Current View" image when a screenshot event is received.

## Technical Notes
*   Use `FastAPI` WebSockets.
*   Frontend: Native `WebSocket` API or `vue-use` websocket wrapper.
