# Story 2.2: Agent Execution Engine (V1)

## Description
Implement the core `Agent` class in Python that acts as the execution engine. This version focuses on basic execution using the `browser-use` library to drive the browser based on the test case instructions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Agent Class**: Create/Update `backend/app/agent/core.py`.
2.  **Initialization**: Agent accepts configuration (LLM provider, API Key) and initializes `browser-use` components.
3.  **Execution Loop**:
    *   Method `execute_case(case: TestCase)`.
    *   Constructs a consolidated Task prompt from `case.url` and `case.steps`.
    *   Initializes `browser_use.Agent` with the task and `browser_use.browser.BrowserProfile`.
4.  **Step Execution**:
    *   Delegates the autonomous execution to `browser_use`.
    *   Emits execution logs and final status.
5.  **Basic Reporting**: Return a simple "Pass/Fail" result based on agent completion.

## Technical Notes
*   **Configuration**: Use `backend/config.yaml` to store model configuration.
*   **Library**: Use `browser-use` for agentic browser automation.
*   **LLM Integration**: Use `langchain-openai` (via `browser-use`) to connect to the configured model (e.g., Qwen, Zhipu).
*   **Browser**: Managed by `browser-use` (defaulting to headed mode for visibility).
*   **Prompting**: Construct a clear, multi-step prompt that guides the `browser-use` agent to perform actions and verifications sequentially.
